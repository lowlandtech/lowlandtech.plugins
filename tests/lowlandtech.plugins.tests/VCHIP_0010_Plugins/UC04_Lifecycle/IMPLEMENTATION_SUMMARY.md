# Plugin Lifecycle Tests - Implementation Summary

## Completed Scenarios (SC01-SC06)

I have successfully implemented the first 6 test scenarios for the Plugin Lifecycle Management (UC04) feature:

### ? SC01 - Execute Install Phase During Plugin Registration
**File**: `SC01_InstallPhase.cs`
- Tests that Install method is called during plugin registration
- Verifies services are registered in the service collection
- Confirms services are available via dependency injection
- Validates Install completes successfully

### ? SC02 - Execute ConfigureContext Phase Asynchronously
**File**: `SC02_ConfigureContextPhase.cs`
- Tests asynchronous ConfigureContext execution
- Verifies method completes without errors
- Confirms returned Task completes successfully
- Validates async configuration behavior

### ? SC03 - Execute Configure Phase with Service Provider
**File**: `SC03_ConfigurePhase.cs`
- Tests Configure method with built service provider
- Verifies plugin has access to all registered services
- Confirms plugin can resolve its own services
- Validates Configure completes successfully

### ? SC04 - Execute Configure Phase with Host Object (ASP.NET Core)
**File**: `SC04_ConfigureWithHost.cs`
- Tests Configure with WebApplication host
- Verifies plugin receives WebApplication instance
- Confirms plugin can configure routes
- Validates plugin can configure middleware
- Tests ASP.NET Core integration

### ? SC05 - Complete Lifecycle Flow
**File**: `SC05_CompleteLifecycleFlow.cs`
- Tests full lifecycle execution order
- Verifies Install executes first
- Confirms ConfigureContext executes after Install
- Validates Configure executes last
- Tracks execution order with callback mechanism

### ? SC06 - Plugin Registers Services During Install
**File**: `SC06_RegisterServices.cs`
- Tests service registration with different lifetimes
- Verifies singleton service registration and behavior
- Confirms scoped service registration and scoping
- Validates transient service registration
- Tests all services are resolvable

## Test Infrastructure Created

### LifecycleTestFixture.cs
Comprehensive test infrastructure including:

1. **LifecycleTestFixture** - Base test fixture for lifecycle tests

2. **TestLifecyclePlugin** - Full-featured test plugin with:
   - Phase execution tracking (Install, ConfigureContext, Configure)
   - Exception capture for each phase
   - Parameter tracking (ServiceProvider, Host)
   - Route and middleware configuration flags
   - Execution order callback support
   - Service registration in Install phase

3. **ServiceRegistrationPlugin** - Demonstrates service lifetime registration:
   - Singleton services
   - Scoped services
   - Transient services

4. **Test Service Classes**:
   - `TestPluginService` - Basic service for Install phase tests
   - `SingletonTestService` - Singleton lifetime demonstration
   - `ScopedTestService` - Scoped lifetime demonstration
   - `TransientTestService` - Transient lifetime demonstration

- ? Service resolution in Configure phase

### ASP.NET Core Integration
- ? WebApplication host parameter
- ? Route configuration
- ? Middleware configuration
- ? Host access in Configure phase

### Tracking & Validation
- ? Phase execution flags
- ? Exception capture per phase
- ? Parameter capture (ServiceProvider, Host)
- ? Execution order tracking
- ? Success/failure validation

## Testing Patterns Used

### 1. WhenTestingForV2 Pattern
All tests inherit from `WhenTestingForV2<T>` with:
- `Given()` - Test setup
- `When()` - Action execution
- `[Fact]` + `[Then]` - Assertions with UAC tracking

### 2. Scenario Attribute
Each test class has full BDD traceability:
```csharp
[Scenario(
    specId: "VCHIP-0010-UC04-SC##",
    title: "Descriptive title",
    given: "Given context",
    when: "When action",
    then: "Then outcome")]
```

### 3. Async Testing
Proper async/await patterns for:
- ConfigureContext phase testing
- Configure phase testing
- Task completion validation

### 4. Service Lifetime Testing
Reference equality checks for:
- Singleton verification (same instance)
- Scoped verification (same within scope, different across scopes)
- Transient verification (always different)

## Documentation

### README.md Created
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Overview of all 6 scenarios
- Lifecycle phases explanation
- Test infrastructure description
- Running instructions
- Best practices
- Coverage summary
- Future scenarios roadmap

---

## Build Status

? **All tests compile successfully**
- No build errors
- All dependencies resolved
- Proper namespace organization
- Clean code with XML documentation

---

## Next Steps

To complete UC04, implement scenarios SC07-SC16:

### Remaining Scenarios
- **SC07**: Virtual ConfigureContext default implementation
- **SC08**: UsePlugins executes Configure on all plugins
- **SC09**: Plugin Configure with null host
- **SC10**: Plugin accesses dependencies during Configure
- **SC11**: Exception handling during Install
- **SC12**: Exception handling during ConfigureContext
- **SC13**: Exception handling during Configure
- **SC14**: Plugin metadata preservation
- **SC15**: Multiple plugins execute independently
- **SC16**: Plugin Assemblies collection accessibility
